# Welcome to Team Nando's Public Repositories!

***Interested in Distribution Networks, Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), and Smart Grids?***

Here you will find multiple repositories produced by [Prof Nando Ochoa](https://sites.google.com/view/luisfochoa)‚Äôs Research Team at [The University of Melbourne](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy). These repositories can help you understand and develop advanced techniques to model and analyse distribution networks with DERs such as residential solar PV ‚òÄÔ∏èüè°, electric vehicles üîåüöó, batteries üîã, etc.

The repositories have been designed for power engineers, students, researchers, consultants, etc. They require some knowledge of coding (of course! ü§ì) but not too advanced üòâ.

## 1. Operating Envelope (OE) Algorithms
These repositories demonstrate, using interactive code via Jupyter Notebook and Python, different Operating Envelope (OE) algorithms that could be implemented by distribution companies. This work is part of the CSIRO-funded project [Assessing the Benefits of Using Operating Envelopes to Orchestrate DERs Across Australia](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/assessing-the-benefits-of-OEs-across-Australia)
- OE Algorithm 1: Ideal (***available soon***)
- OE Algorithm 2: Asset Capacity (***available soon***)
- OE Algorithm 3: Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE (***available soon***)
- OE Algorithm 4: Asset Capacity & Delta Voltage OE (***available soon***)

## 2. Tutorial on DER Hosting Capacity
This tutorial will guide you, using interactive code via Jupyter Notebook and Python, through the different steps to run advanced, detailed time-series simulations to properly assess the technical impacts of DERs (such as solar photovoltaics) on realistic three-phase unbalanced distribution networks.

- [Part 1: Advanced Tools for the Analysis of Three-Phase Unbalanced LV Networks](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-1-AdvancedTools_LV)
- [Part 2: Time-Series Analysis of Three-Phase Unbalanced LV Networks](https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-2-TimeSeries_LV)

*Want to learn more about ***DER Hosting Capacity***? Visit the [PV-Rich Distribution Networks Project](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/project-edge) and the [EV Integration Project](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/ev-integration).*

## 3. DER Profiles
These repositories provide realistic time-series DER profiles necessary to carry out detailed distribution network studies.

## 4. AC Optimal Power Flow for Distribution Networks
These repositories provide examples of how the AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) can be used for different distribution network applications.
